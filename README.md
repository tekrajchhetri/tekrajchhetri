# 👋 Hi, I'm Tek Raj Chhetri, PhD  

🌐 [Website](https://tekrajchhetri.com) | 📖 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QfpwmIIAAAAJ&hl=en) | 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tekrajchhetri) | 📧 [Email Me](mailto:tekraj.chhetri@cair-nepal.org)  

I'm a researcher, developer, and educator passionate about solving complex problems through innovative AI and semantic web technologies, such as knowledge graphs and sharing knowledge with others. 
Currently, I work as a **Postdoctoral Associate** at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**, where I lead the development of [BrainKB](https://sensein.group/brainkbdocs), a large-scale neuroscience knowledge graph designed to empower collaborative research and evidence-based decision-making.  

As the **founder of [CAIR-Nepal](https://cair-nepal.org/)**, an artificial intelligence research organization, I bring a global perspective to addressing challenges at the intersection of technology, society, and science. Through [CAIR-Nepal](https://cair-nepal.org/), I actively involve Nepalese youth in research opportunities and foster community engagement to drive innovation and societal impact in Nepal and beyond.

With a PhD in Computer Science and extensive experience in developing innovative scalable and intelligent systems, I specialize in:  

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Expertise in RDF, OWL, Neo4j, semantic web technologies, and their applications in privacy-aware data sharing, decision-making, and automation.  
- **AI/ML**: Expertise in Explainable AI, large language models (LLMs), predictive modeling, Bayesian structure learning, and AI applications for healthcare and sustainability.  
- **Software Development**: Advanced skills in designing scalable architectures, developing robust APIs (e.g., FastAPI with JWT authentication), and deploying cloud-based solutions using AWS and Docker.  
- **Data Privacy & Management**: Expertise in FAIR data sharing, GDPR compliance, dynamic consent management, and privacy-preserving frameworks using semantic modeling and ODRL.  
- **Distributed Systems & IoT**: Applied research in distributed systems, edge intelligence, and IoT for real-time data analysis and system optimization.

## 🌟 What I am Working On?  
- **BrainKB**, a large-scale neuroscience knowledge graph infrastructure designed to facilitate collaborative research, evidence-based decision-making, and reproducibility in neuroscience.  
- Founding and directing **CAIR-Nepal**, an AI research organization empowering Nepalese youth through research opportunities, community engagement, and innovations in Responsible AI and digital healthcare.  
-  Designing and implementing adaptive graph systems that account for evolving knowledge, seamlessly integrating large language models (LLMs) to enable real-time knowledge extraction, verification, and analytics pipelines.
